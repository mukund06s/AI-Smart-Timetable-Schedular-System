# AI-Smart-Timetable-Schedular-System
AI-powered scheduling for smarter campuses

An AI-driven smart classroom and academic timetable scheduling system designed for colleges and universities.
The system automatically generates optimized, clash-free timetables by considering faculty availability, room constraints, program-wise lunch timings, workload balance, and institutional rules.

This project is suitable for real-world academic deployment and is being migrated toward a MERN-based production system.
